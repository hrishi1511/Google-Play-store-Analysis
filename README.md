# Google-Play-store-Analysis
📱 EDA & Data Preprocessing on Google App Store Rating Dataset

In the ever-expanding landscape of mobile applications, success hinges on understanding user preferences and market trends. This project delves into the vast repository of Google Play Store data, comprising 10,000 app entries, to extract invaluable insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and meticulous data preprocessing.

Objective:
The primary objective is to glean actionable insights and preprocess the dataset, laying a solid foundation for future predictive analytics endeavors within the Android app market.

Dataset Information:
The dataset comprises web-scraped data of Play Store apps, encompassing essential attributes such as category, rating, size, and more, essential for understanding app performance and user engagement dynamics.

Key Tasks & Findings:

📊 Comprehensive exploration of dataset characteristics, including shape, data types, and summary statistics, to identify areas for data preprocessing and model refinement.
🔄 Removal of duplicate records and invalid categories to ensure data integrity and accuracy in subsequent analyses.
🌟 Creation of a new categorical feature 'Rating_category' based on app ratings, facilitating a deeper understanding of user sentiment and app performance.
📈 Detection and handling of outliers in the 'Reviews' column through a log transformation approach, enhancing the robustness of the dataset.
📏 Standardization of data, ensuring uniformity and comparability across different features, vital for effective model training and evaluation.
Next Steps:

Feature engineering and selection to enhance predictive model performance.
Implementation of machine learning algorithms for app success prediction.
Evaluation of model performance through rigorous testing and validation procedures.
Conclusion:
This project underscores the significance of EDA and data preprocessing in extracting actionable insights from complex datasets, laying the groundwork for informed decision-making and strategic planning within the dynamic realm of mobile app development
